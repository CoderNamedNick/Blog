    Hello and welcome to the first Official Blog post of Nick.Blog!
    I think there is no better place than to start than with how I'm making this blog. I am creating this blog, first and foremost, for my portfolio, so not only can you get to know me, but employers can too.
    This blog is built using the React Library, with a few NPM add-ons, but mostly just React.
    Doing this with React is a lot easier than what plain JS code can be.
    This blog has yet to give me massive trouble, but I did learn some new things. I learned about Links, Routes, etc. If you don't know what that is, it's how React Apps have "Multiple Pages". 
    Doing this blog makes me feel calm, as I'm not rushing to get anything new out, whereas with my other projects, I felt rushed and stressed to do something "cool" or "advanced". With most of this, it's just simple JSX.
    `,
   `
   From me to you, I'll share a few tips for making a blog, in case you find yourself doing the same in the future.
   Step 1: Just do it. Personally, I'm a huge procrastinator. Instead of reviewing code or looking up React courses, in two hours, I'd probably be nose-deep in a video game. So, save yourself the trouble of not doing it and just do it.
   Step 2: Choose a framework, library, or just plain JS. I'm a huge advocate of plain JS. I believe you can accomplish anything you can do with a framework. "But Nick, it will take so much longer!" Yes, but you learn the fundamentals, where everything started: just HTML, CSS, and JS.
   Step 3: Make it your website. I'm known as a boring guy, and my blog might reflect that. But you need to show that it's yours and not some marketing tool.
   Final Step: Learn. Improve. Accomplish something. You're never going to improve your coding skills by just doing stuff you've already done. Like a whole month ago, I didn't even know how to do anything in React. Now, look at this site. Your main goal should be to learn.

    ` Today is 3/18/24, and it's the very first day of "Work," even though I don't have a job.
    You can still work, and I mean work towards a job in my case. Yesterday I did some learning, and I want my workplace blogs to not only help myself jog my memory and write it down but also to assist anyone in my shoes going through what I am.
   Another quick note is before you learn or do anything new, or maybe you have 20+ years, just remember that you aren't expected to master anything in one day, and it will never happen. So, take your time and learn/work at your pace, and that's improvement.
   Yesterday I watched some videos on APIs and Promises, and I wanna talk first on APIs.`
   ,
    ` WHY ARE APIs SO CONFUSING TO LEARN! Trust me, I've seen countless videos trying to explain what an API is.
    API stands for Application Programming Interface..... which tells you nothing about what it is. In short terms, it is "a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other."
    And in Nick Terms, it's how computers talk with other computers. I like to think that it's like a firm handshake.
    When you walk up to your boss, you shake his hand. Computers shake hands and say, "Here is what I can do and what I have. What do you want?"
    Trust me, if you're struggling with this idea, we all are or were! And if you didn't, lucky you!`
    ,
   ` Promises. This is actually super simple. I love it when coding terms actually make sense for what the name implies.
   Promises are exactly what you think they are; they are a promise that you get when you ask another computer out there something. When you ask a computer something, for example, 
   you ask a database what your username is, the computer sends you a promise. "I PROMISE I will try to get that for you." It then goes and returns what it got. 
   It normally comes back with a code saying "Got it" or a code error saying "Sorry, I dropped it." With promises, you can use a '.then' after the promise to do something after you get a response.
   I find that normally you just put a ".then" to make it into JSON. JSON is another topic for another day.`
   ,
    `  I went on a bit of a coding ramble, but I still want to leave this in the work section because work comes with struggles and times when you don't understand anything you are doing.
    WORK HARD. And please, never give up.`,

      `Welcome to the First Personal Blog! These blogs are going to be about daily personal life. Mostly, it will be venting, maybe something interesting happening at the moment, or possibly even some one-on-one talk with me about what people talk about. Today's topic is going to be my daily life because right now you know of me, but you don't know Nick.blog.
      `,
      `Most days, I wake up at around 10 am to take my partner to work. I normally get my coffee too. I don't have a lot of friends, so when I get home, most of my days are spent coding or learning about some new coding topics. For example, yesterday, I watched videos on React props. Even though I use them a lot and feel like I know a lot about them, having someone explain it in a different way and use it is like a big refresher. To compare it to what everyone would get, it's like someone explaining how to jump. Everyone knows how to jump, but to see someone who is far better than you break it down is entertaining and informative. After coding and watching videos, I like to look around on GitHub. I have an obsession with seeing my own repos and the little green squares I get for coding every day.`,
      `In the afternoon, I like to relax. I'm an avid gamer. I play LoL, Helldivers, and lately, I've been into a farming game called Palia. After I pick up my partner from work, we go eat, and we normally spend time together. We like playing games with each other or watching a show. Lately, we have been watching The Walking Dead and have made it to Season 8, so please don't spoil. `, 
      `If you know me, I like going to the gym, and lately, I haven't been in a minute to let my body stress levels go down. Going to the gym is my number one recommended way to feel accomplished. I was going to the gym every day for a whole year straight, while doing cardio and weight training. Right now, I'm 20, 5'7", and 145 pounds. In another personal blog, I want to talk about my gym routine and maybe other things. What I want in my day is accomplishment. I like to feel that it was a day gained and not one lost. Make your days ones that make you feel the same.`

    `The First Random Blog of Nick.Blog! These blogs are going to be about anything that doesn't fit into the previous categories and will help you get to know me just a little bit more. If you don't know me, I'm trying to become a 'front-end web developer.' It's a hard goal for anyone, but my days aren't just spent coding and doing research. So, what do I do when I'm not coding?`,
    `My first hobby is gaming. I used to play games every day, all day, ranging from any title from FPS to MOBA to even farming sims. What mainly got me into gaming was the FPS Call of Duty, which is very popular. Later on, I actually went into a minor league tournament in the game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. Gaming is a huge part of my life; it's a place where I feel like I can enter a different 'world' and experience what a person or group of people made with just 1s and 0s. This is mainly the reason I got into coding â€“ to make something that maybe someone else would enjoy. If you are interested in my portfolio, I even made an RPG-like game for people to play.` ,
    `Secondly, I am an avid anime and manga fan and own quite a bit of it. I mainly watched mainstream anime like One Piece and Naruto, with Hunter x Hunter being my favorite. But recently, I've been watching more romance-involved ones, and there are some good ones to watch. As of today, I started to re-read my graphic novels of Sword Art Online, one of my all-time favorites. Reading to me is like gaming too; it puts you in a world someone else made, with the added bonus that it's better on the eyes than gaming.`, 
    `My hobbies may not be numerous, but I tend not to let them interfere with my day-to-day activities. I see hobbies as something to indulge in only when I have the time. You will never see me playing a game or picking up a book instead of adding a new feature, studying my code, or spending time with my family. People tend to get absorbed in hobbies and forget about very important things. Make sure that YOU control your life.`

  Body: [
    `Hello! It's been a while, and I have been on the 'grind,' learning more and more that I can to secure that all-impressive 'Junior Dev Job.' If you ever look at the jobs you are aiming for, it's not only a must to have the qualifications, but also extra skills. Since I am aiming for a Front End Dev position, I need to know front-end development, but why not at least know both?`,
    `Learning back-end has actually been really fun and has given me a new joy while coding. There is a lot I still don't know about front-end, and that skill only improves with time. But learning back-end makes you feel that you understand the whole picture of what you are trying to do a little better. For example, it's like working at a bakery and never actually seeing how the bread you are selling is made. When you go and learn the processes, it improves not only the work that you have but also the understanding.` ,
    `For learning backend, I like to break it down into two types:

    The Database - I actually don't know a lot about databases, like queries and formats. Luckily, most sites handle almost everything for you and even provide a nice user interface to help. I use MongoDB, a backend database, which pretty much does everything for you, and with Mongoose, it's even easier.
    
    REST API / Endpoints - Look, I may have this wrong, but this is like the bread and butter of backend! You want to send user data to the database? HERE! JSON APIs? HERE! HTTP requests? HERE!"`, 
    `As I'm still learning, I just wanted to talk about how this has given me a new perspective on front-end, and I enjoy backend a lot because it's a journey to learn. When I was hooked on front-end, it was the same. It's much more fun to learn!`

    `Hello and I am back. its been about 4 months since the Last blog, and no I have not quit! Lately ive been working on my new big project Tavern, A fantasy community hub. I wanna talk a little bit about why I made Tavern and what it has help me do. `,
    `Building a website seem easy. All you have to do is find content that people would want put it one the internet and "BAM" website made! That seem easy but when you thing of content what comes to mind? For me nothing came to mind and to get a job in web developement "without schooling" is already hard enough. not to mention in earlier blogs i have no coding background! so i want to make something that shines and makes companies want to choose me. That being said the one and true way to make a website making employers want you is to make an awesome website.` ,
    `Tavern was my first good idea I wanted to make something, Anything, That not only tested my "skills", but also made and forced me to learn new topics and make me better. Tavern is My first website that has a full backend service and completely made with the MERN stack ("MongoDB","Express JS","React JS","NODE JS"), I want to become a frontend developer, but knowing backend and DevOps is a huge spike on the resume! The resume comes after the website so i needed to put my head to the grind stone and actually work!  `, 
    `Obviously I know that people dont read this random blog but someday I want where to look back at all my previous work and thoughts and if you are reading this. Thank you.`
