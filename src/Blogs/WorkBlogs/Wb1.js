        Today is 3/18/24, and it's the very first day of "Work," even though I don't have a job.
         You can still work, and I mean work towards a job in my case. Yesterday I did some learning, and I want my workplace blogs to not only help myself jog my memory and write it down but also to assist anyone in my shoes going through what I am.
        Another quick note is before you learn or do anything new, or maybe you have 20+ years, just remember that you aren't expected to master anything in one day, and it will never happen. So, take your time and learn/work at your pace, and that's improvement.
        Yesterday I watched some videos on APIs and Promises, and I wanna talk first on APIs.
      </p>
      <p className="All-Work-p">
        WHY ARE APIs SO CONFUSING TO LEARN! Trust me, I've seen countless videos trying to explain what an API is.
        API stands for Application Programming Interface..... which tells you nothing about what it is. In short terms, it is "a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other."
        And in Nick Terms, it's how computers talk with other computers. I like to think that it's like a firm handshake.
        When you walk up to your boss, you shake his hand. Computers shake hands and say, "Here is what I can do and what I have. What do you want?"
        Trust me, if you're struggling with this idea, we all are or were! And if you didn't, lucky you!

        Promises. This is actually super simple. I love it when coding terms actually make sense for what the name implies.
        Promises are exactly what you think they are; they are a promise that you get when you ask another computer out there something. When you ask a computer something, for example, 
        you ask a database what your username is, the computer sends you a promise. "I PROMISE I will try to get that for you." It then goes and returns what it got. 
        It normally comes back with a code saying "Got it" or a code error saying "Sorry, I dropped it." With promises, you can use a '.then' after the promise to do something after you get a response.
        I find that normally you just put a ".then" to make it into JSON. JSON is another topic for another day.

      <p className="All-Work-p">
        I went on a bit of a coding ramble, but I still want to leave this in the work section because work comes with struggles and times when you don't understand anything you are doing.
        <br></br>
        WORK HARD. And please, never give up.
