        Hello and welcome to the first Official Blog post of Nick.Blog!<br></br>
        I think there is no better place than to start than with how I'm making this blog. I am creating this blog, first and foremost, for my portfolio, so not only can you get to know me, but employers can too.
        This blog is built using the React Library, with a few NPM add-ons, but mostly just React.
        Doing this with React is a lot easier than what plain JS code can be.<br></br>
        This blog has yet to give me massive trouble, but I did learn some new things. I learned about Links, Routes, etc. If you don't know what that is, it's how React Apps have "Multiple Pages". 
        Doing this blog makes me feel calm, as I'm not rushing to get anything new out, whereas with my other projects, I felt rushed and stressed to do something "cool" or "advanced". With most of this, it's just simple JSX.
      </p>
      <p className="All-coding-p">
        From me to you, I'll share a few tips for making a blog, in case you find yourself doing the same in the future.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Step 1: Just do it. Personally, I'm a huge procrastinator. Instead of reviewing code or looking up React courses, in two hours, I'd probably be nose-deep in a video game. So, save yourself the trouble of not doing it and just do it.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Step 2: Choose a framework, library, or just plain JS. I'm a huge advocate of plain JS. I believe you can accomplish anything you can do with a framework. "But Nick, it will take so much longer!" Yes, but you learn the fundamentals, where everything started: just HTML, CSS, and JS.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Step 3: Make it your website. I'm known as a boring guy, and my blog might reflect that. But you need to show that it's yours and not some marketing tool.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Final Step: Learn. Improve. Accomplish something. You're never going to improve your coding skills by just doing stuff you've already done. Like a whole month ago, I didn't even know how to do anything in React. Now, look at this site. Your main goal should be to learn.
