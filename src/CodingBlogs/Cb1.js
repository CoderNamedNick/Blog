        Hello and welcome to the first Offical Blog post of Nick.Blog! i think there is no better place than to start with how im making this blog.
        I am making this blog first and foremost for my portfolio and so that not only you but employers can get to know me to.
        This blog is made from the React Libary, with a few NPM add ons but mostly just React. doing this with react is alot easier then what just 
        plane JS code can be. This blog has yet to give me massive trouble but I did learn some New things. I learned Links and Routes, ect.
        If you dont know what that is It how react Apps have "Multiple Pages". Doing this blog makes me feel calm as im not rushing to get anything new out as where my other
        projects i felt rushed and stress to do something "cool" or "Advanced" with most of this Its Just simple JSX.
      </p>
      <p className="All-coding-p">
        From me to you ill pass a few tips to make a blog if in the future you see yourself doing the same.
        Step 1: Do It. Me myself im a huge procrastinater instead of reveiwing code or look up react courses in 2 hours ill probably be nose deep in a video game
        so hey save the trouble of not doing it and do it.
